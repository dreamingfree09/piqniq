- MongoDB (v4.4 or higher)
- Git

### Setup Steps

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/dreamingfree09/piqniq.git
   cd piqniq
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Set up environment variables:**
   Create a `.env` file in the root directory:
   ```env
   MONGODB_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/piqniq
   SESSION_SECRET=your-super-secret-key-here
   # Auto-logout after inactivity (minutes). Set to 0 to disable.
   SESSION_IDLE_TIMEOUT_MINUTES=30
   PORT=3000
   ```

   Optional performance toggles:
   ```env
   # Set to 'false' to disable on-the-fly WebP image optimization
   # (useful for constrained hosts or read-only filesystems)
   IMAGE_OPTIMIZATION=true
   ```

4. **Start MongoDB:**
   ```bash
   # On Windows
   net start MongoDB
   
   # On Mac/Linux
   sudo systemctl start mongod
   ```

5. **Run the application:**
   ```bash
   # Recommended on Windows (kills stale port listeners first)
   npm run start:clean

   # Or start directly
   node app.js
   ```

6. **Access the application:**
   Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000`

---

## 🐳 Docker (Compose) Deployment

This repo includes a `Dockerfile` and `docker-compose.yml` that you can use for a production-like deployment (recommended for Proxmox VMs and servers).

1. Create a `.env` file:

   ```env
   NODE_ENV=production
   SESSION_SECRET=<generate-a-long-random-secret>

   # Auto-logout after inactivity (minutes). Set to 0 to disable.
   SESSION_IDLE_TIMEOUT_MINUTES=30

   # Used by docker-compose.yml to initialize MongoDB and to build the default MONGODB_URI
   MONGO_USERNAME=admin
   MONGO_PASSWORD=<replace-me>

   # Strongly recommended when behind HTTPS
   BASE_URL=https://community.example.com
   ALLOWED_ORIGINS=https://community.example.com

   # Optional: explicitly force secure cookies
   # COOKIE_SECURE=true

   # Optional: privacy-minded hashing salt for pseudonymized telemetry
   # PII_HASH_SALT=<another-random-secret>
   ```

2. Build + start:

   ```bash
   docker compose up -d --build
   ```

3. Verify health:

   ```bash
   curl -fsS http://localhost:3000/api/system/health
   ```

Notes:
- The Docker setup persists logs and uploads via bind mounts (`logs/`, `public/uploads/`, `uploads/`, and `public/Images/`).
- MongoDB is not exposed on host port 27017 by default. Use `docker compose exec mongodb mongosh ...` for admin access.

### Common URLs

- **Home**: `http://localhost:3000/`
- **Forum**: `http://localhost:3000/forum`
- **Resources**: `http://localhost:3000/resources`
- **Pathways**: `http://localhost:3000/pathways`
- **Portfolio (editor)**: `http://localhost:3000/portfolio`
- **Portfolio (invite-only view)**: `http://localhost:3000/portfolio/<username>?token=<token>`
- **Study Room (sign-in required)**: `http://localhost:3000/study`
- **Admin panel**: `http://localhost:3000/admin`

## 👑 Superadmin (Owner) Account

Piqniq supports a dedicated **owner/superadmin** account that you can keep separate from your personal/regular account.

### Why two accounts?

- **Superadmin**: used to manage the platform (grant roles/permissions, staff actions, etc.).
- **Regular user**: used as your normal community identity so badges/reputation remain comparable to everyone else.

### Important security behavior

Automatic “first user becomes superadmin” bootstrapping is **disabled by default**.
To create a superadmin, use the bootstrap script below.

### Create (or promote) a superadmin user

Run:

```bash
npm run admin:bootstrap
```

Then follow the interactive prompt to enter the password (input is hidden).
You can also provide values via environment variables:

```env
ADMIN_EMAIL=owner@example.com
ADMIN_USERNAME=superuser
ADMIN_PASSWORD=YourPasswordHere
```

Notes:

- The script is idempotent: if the user already exists by email, it will promote/update it to superadmin.
- The script seeds system roles and assigns the Admin role.
- Safety: if `NODE_ENV=production`, the script refuses to run unless `CONFIRM_PRODUCTION_BOOTSTRAP=true`.

## 💬 Live Chat Rooms (Curated Names)

Note: the Live Chat page (`/livechat` / `/livechat.html`) is **sign-in required**. Guests are redirected to Home and prompted to sign in.

If you previously created a bunch of public rooms with auto-generated names (for example `public_abc123...`), you can rename them into a cleaner, purpose-based set.

Run:

```bash
npm run chat:rooms:curate
```

What it does:

- Ensures a default set of public rooms exists:
   - `lobby`, `help`, `announcements`, `introductions`, `general`, `projects`, `study`, `resources`, `career`, `feedback`
   - `voice-1` through `voice-5`
- Renames existing auto-generated public rooms (matching `public_*`) into the list above first.
- Renames any remaining `public_*` rooms to `extra-1`, `extra-2`, etc.
- Does not delete rooms or messages.

## 📰 Tech News Feed (RSS Aggregation)

The Home page Tech News section is powered by the `GET /api/news` endpoint.

- The server aggregates a handful of allowlisted RSS/Atom feeds and returns a merged list.
- The list is cached briefly server-side to avoid hitting upstream sites on every page load.

Optional environment variables:

```env
# Cache TTL for aggregated news (milliseconds)
NEWS_CACHE_TTL_MS=600000

# Per-feed fetch timeout (milliseconds)
NEWS_FETCH_TIMEOUT_MS=7000

# Max upstream feed size (bytes)
NEWS_MAX_BYTES=750000
```

## 🖼️ Image Optimization Cache

When `IMAGE_OPTIMIZATION` is enabled (default), the server may generate WebP versions of PNG/JPG images on demand and store them on disk under `.cache/images-webp/`.

- This folder is safe to delete at any time (it will be regenerated as needed).
- In production, ensure the app has write access to `.cache/` (or mount it as a persistent volume if you want the cache to survive restarts).
- To disable this behavior entirely, set `IMAGE_OPTIMIZATION=false`.

## 🚀 From-Scratch Setup + Usage (End-to-End)

This section is written for someone starting with a fresh clone and an empty database.

### 1) Start the app locally

1. Install dependencies: `npm install`
2. Copy env file: `cp .env.example .env` (or create `.env` manually)
3. Ensure MongoDB is running (local service or Docker)
4. Start the server:
   - Recommended: `npm run start:clean`
   - Alternative: `node app.js`
5. Confirm health check: `http://localhost:3000/api/system/health`

### 2) Create your first admin account

By default, **no account is auto-promoted** to superadmin (in any environment).

Recommended (safe, explicit):

1. Register a normal account via `http://localhost:3000`
2. Promote/create the owner account using:

   ```bash
   npm run admin:bootstrap
   ```

Optional (one-time convenience for dev only):
- You may set `ALLOW_SUPERADMIN_BOOTSTRAP=true` to promote the first-ever registered account when there are zero superadmins.

### 3) Curated tags + resources

There are two ways to get curated Tags/Resources into the database:

**Option A: Seed curated starter content (recommended for fresh clones / empty DB)**

1. Ensure MongoDB is running.
2. Run the curated seed script (idempotent; safe to re-run):
   - `npm run seed:curated`
3. Visit the public resources page: `http://localhost:3000/resources`

**Option B: Manage content in the admin panel**

1. In the admin panel, create/edit **Tags** (tags are curated; users pick from the list)
2. Create/edit **Resources** (links and/or uploaded PDFs)
    - Optional metadata (useful for “free lessons” + YouTube discovery):
       - `platformName` + `platformUrl` (e.g., free learning platforms)
       - `creatorName` + `creatorUrl` (e.g., YouTube creators/channels)
3. Visit the public resources page: `http://localhost:3000/resources`

Troubleshooting: if the Resources page shows no results, confirm the API returns items:
- `http://localhost:3000/api/resources?page=1&limit=10`
- If it returns `items: []`, run `npm run seed:curated` (or add resources via the admin panel).

Optional (dev only): if your MongoDB gets reset/cleared frequently, you can enable automatic recovery:
- Set `AUTO_SEED_CURATED=true` and restart the server.
- When enabled, `GET /api/resources` will auto-run the curated seeder once if it detects an empty Resources collection.

### 4) Career Pathways (editable by Content/Admin)

1. In the admin panel, edit the Pathways content
2. Visit the public pathways page: `http://localhost:3000/pathways`

### 5) Forum

1. Visit the forum: `http://localhost:3000/forum`
2. Create a post and select tags from the curated tag picker
3. Engage by replying and liking/upvoting

### 6) Portfolios (Site + Personal)

**Personal portfolio (invite-only):**

1. Open your portfolio editor: `http://localhost:3000/portfolio`
2. Add skills and projects
3. Generate an invite link from the Portfolio page
4. Share the invite link; it will look like:
   `/portfolio/<your-username>?token=<token>`

**Site portfolio (public):**

- Everyone can view the site portfolio feed (shown on the Portfolio page and via `GET /api/site-portfolio`).
- Content/Admin staff can manage site portfolio items.

## 🔐 Roles & Permissions (High Level)

- **Admin**: full admin access (roles/users/tags/resources/system)
- **Content**: can manage pathways and create/update resources (no user/role management)
- **Moderator**: moderation-focused access (pin/remove content, chat moderation)

Role assignment is done from the admin panel.

## Collaboration workflow

[Continuity](Docs/CONTINUITY.md) records verified revisions and active assignments. [GHP-01](Docs/GHP-01.md) defines exact-revision publication, worker acknowledgement and independent Aether review. [Agent instructions](AGENTS.md) define execution boundaries alongside the existing [Copilot instructions](.github/copilot-instructions.md). Existing product and deployment documentation is preserved; workflow installation does not claim fresh application-test results.
